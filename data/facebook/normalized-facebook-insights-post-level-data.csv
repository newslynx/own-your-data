'Marketplace' traders in UK and major European markets are to be hit by fee hikes of up to 70% after Easter, following similar rises in US.

Trader fees on millions of electronic accessories listed on Amazon – including popular items such as memory cards, headphones and printer cartridges – will jump from 7% to 12% for the busiest traders in the UK and four other major European markets from 4 April, just after the Easter weekend.

Bees exposed to two kinds of pesticide were slower to learn or completely forgot links between floral scents and nectar.

These effects could make it harder for bees to forage among flowers for food, thereby threatening their survival and reducing the pollination of crops and wild plants.

The findings add to existing research that neonicotinoid pesticides are contributing to the decline in bee populations.

More than four decades on, Fang's son is seeking to atone by telling her story and calling for the preservation of her grave in their home town of Guzhen, central Anhui province, as a cultural relic.

Fang's plot is already hemmed in by buildings and a wall is rising behind it. Without official recognition, fears Zhang Hongbing, his mother's grave and story could soon be swept away – part of a wider, shadowed past that is fast disappearing.

Doctors said a simple £5 spit-test based on the markers could provide patients with a personalised &quot;risk profile&quot; for the diseases and pave the way for individually tailored screening, with those most at risk having more regular health checks.

Nick D'Aloisio, from Wimbledon, south London, created the app, called Summly – which provides bite-sized summaries of content from news and other sites – a little over a year ago from his bedroom and now joins an elite group of teenagers who have become internet millionaires.

D'Aloisio began using computers at the age of nine, making films, and then moved to programming at the age of 12 when Apple opened its App Store for the iPhone.

Fewer butterflies flew in British skies in the miserable summer of 2012 than for thousands of years, leaving several species in danger of extinction from parts of the country.

The country's most endangered butterfly, the high brown fritillary, saw its small population slump by 46%, while another rare species, the black hairstreak, fell by 98%, as 300,000 fewer butterflies were recorded on the wing compared with 2011.

Lindt, Thorntons and Guylian rank the lowest on their use of sustainable palm oil in Easter eggs. Divine and Booja-Booja were deemed to have the best overall credentials, with neither using any palm oil in their chocolate products. Cadbury – now owned by Kraft – had poor scores while stablemate Green &amp; Black's did much better. Traidcraft, Co-operative Food and Sainsbury's also scored well.

Unsustainable palm oil poses an increasing threat to the world's rainforests, their indigenous wildlife, and the people whose livelihoods depend on the forests.
