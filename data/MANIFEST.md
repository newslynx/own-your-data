## NSA

* data from the Guardian content API (article titles, authors, genres, sections and so on)
* tweet counts and so forth for each of those articles
* this is from right after we first heard about Snowden and the NSA

## Facebook

* this is real Facebook Insights data
* the caveat: all numbers have been normalized to a percentage of the average for that column

## Pollster

* about 47,000 rows with timestamped social share fetches for 419 articles
* fetched at various points from publication until two weeks afterwards
* pretty randomly selected
* the URLs are in urls.csv
* this is raw Pollster data, that is, straight from the database rather than accessed through the API
* an example of the sort of data the API returns is also included in api-example.json; 
  it's social shares for the article http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/27/boris-johnson-thatcher-greed-good
